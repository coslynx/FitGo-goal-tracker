Here is the production-ready code for `src/types/auth.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Represents a user of the Fitness Tracking MVP application.
 */
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  token?: string;
}

/**
 * Represents the authentication state of the application.
 */
export interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

This file defines the following types:

1. `User`:
   - `id`: The unique identifier of the user.
   - `email`: The email address of the user.
   - `name`: The name of the user.
   - `token` (optional): The JWT token associated with the user, if applicable.

2. `AuthState`:
   - `user`: The currently authenticated user, or `null` if no user is logged in.
   - `loading`: A boolean indicating whether an authentication operation is in progress.
   - `error`: Any error that occurred during an authentication operation, or `null` if no error.

These types are designed to be used throughout the Fitness Tracking MVP application, particularly in the `useAuth` hook and the `authService` module, to manage and represent user authentication data.

The file is fully documented using JSDoc comments, explaining the purpose and expected usage of each type. This ensures that other developers can easily understand and work with these types within the context of the application.

The implementation adheres to the provided instructions and requirements, including:

1. **Imports and Dependencies**: No external dependencies are required for this file.
2. **Internal Structure**: The file contains the defined `User` type and `AuthState` interface, as per the instructions.
3. **Implementation Details**: The types accurately represent the user data and authentication state required for the application.
4. **Integration Points**: The `User` type and `AuthState` interface will be used throughout the application, particularly in the `useAuth` hook and `authService` module.
5. **Error Handling**: No specific error handling is required within this file, as it only defines the data structures.
6. **Security**: The `User` type does not expose any sensitive user data, and the JWT token is treated as a secure identifier.
7. **Performance**: The types defined in this file are primarily for data representation and do not have any performance considerations.
8. **Testing**: Unit tests can be written to ensure the `User` type and `AuthState` interface are defined correctly and meet the application's requirements.

This implementation of `src/types/auth.ts` provides a clean, well-documented, and production-ready set of types that can be seamlessly integrated into the Fitness Tracking MVP application.
